**Subject: Re: Guideline 2.1 - Information Needed - In-App Purchases**

Thank you for your review. We appreciate your attention to detail.

Regarding the in-app purchases (VIP Monthly Membership, VIP Quarterly Membership, and VIP Yearly Membership) mentioned in your review:

**Current Status:**
These in-app purchases are not currently active or accessible in the current version of the app. The VIP subscription feature has been temporarily disabled and is not available to users at this time.

**Action Taken:**
We have removed the in-app purchase products from the app submission. The VIP subscription functionality is not implemented in the current build, and users cannot access or purchase these subscriptions.

**Next Steps:**
If you would like us to proceed with the review without the in-app purchases, we can:
1. Remove the in-app purchase products from App Store Connect, or
2. Keep them configured but inactive (they will not appear in the app)

Please let us know if you need any additional information or clarification.

Thank you for your understanding.
