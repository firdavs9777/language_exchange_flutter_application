# Note: google-services.json and GoogleService-Info.plist are NOT in .gitignore
# because they're required for the app to build. These files contain client-side
# Firebase API keys which are safe to commit (they're meant to be public).
# If you want to keep them private, you can add them back to .gitignore and
# require developers to download them from Firebase Console.
